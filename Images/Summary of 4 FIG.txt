### **Explanation of the Four Figures**  

#### **1. Distribution of Adjusted Interest Rates (Histogram with KDE Plot)**
- This histogram represents the distribution of adjusted interest rates.
- The x-axis denotes the interest rates, while the y-axis represents the frequency of occurrences.
- The histogram bars (in blue) show how often certain interest rates appear in the dataset.
- The overlaid KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) curve (in dark blue) smooths the distribution, showing a continuous approximation.
- The data is somewhat normally distributed, peaking around 8.5% to 9.5%, with fewer instances at the extremes (~7.5% and ~10.5%).
- The slight skewness suggests that more loans are adjusted around 8.5%â€“9.5%, with a gradual tapering off on both ends.

#### **2. Interest Rates by Repayment History (Box Plot)**
- This box plot compares interest rates across different repayment history categories: **good, excellent, and poor**.
- The x-axis represents repayment history categories, while the y-axis represents interest rates.
- **Interpretation:**
  - Borrowers with **excellent** repayment history have higher median interest rates but a more consistent distribution.
  - Borrowers with **good** repayment history have a wider spread of interest rates, suggesting variability in adjustments.
  - Borrowers with **poor** repayment history tend to receive lower interest rates on average but also show the presence of outliers (small circles above the box).
- The whiskers indicate the range of most values, while the box represents the interquartile range (middle 50% of the data).
- The presence of outliers in the "poor" category suggests that some borrowers in this category receive significantly higher interest rates.

#### **3. Credit Score vs. Adjusted Interest Rate (Scatter Plot)**
- This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between credit scores (x-axis) and adjusted interest rates (y-axis).
- **Observations:**
  - The data points are spread widely, indicating variability in how credit scores impact interest rates.
  - Interest rates range between ~7.5% and ~10.5%, but there is no **strong** visible downward trend.
  - Even borrowers with higher credit scores (700â€“900) have diverse interest rates, suggesting that credit score alone is not the sole determinant.
  - For credit scores below 500, interest rates are more varied, suggesting increased risk-based adjustments.
- This plot helps in understanding whether there is a significant negative correlation between credit scores and interest rates.

#### **4. Interest Rate Distribution by Market Trend (Violin Plot)**
- This violin plot compares interest rates under different market trends: **falling, stable, and rising**.
- The width of each section represents the density of data points at different interest rate levels.
- **Key Observations:**
  - All three trends have a somewhat similar distribution, but the **rising trend** shows a slightly wider spread towards higher interest rates.
  - The **falling** and **stable** market trends have more compact distributions, with more density around 8.5%â€“9%.
  - The median interest rates are nearly the same across trends, but extreme values (tails) vary, especially for the rising trend.
- This suggests that market trends might slightly influence interest rate adjustments, but the overall impact appears to be moderate.

### **Overall Summary**
- The first plot shows that interest rates are mostly concentrated around 8.5%â€“9.5%.
- The second plot suggests that repayment history affects interest rate variations.
- The third plot indicates that credit scores alone do not strictly determine interest rates.
- The fourth plot suggests that market trends have a subtle effect on interest rate distribution.



The **correlation matrix heatmap** helps visualize relationships between different numerical variables in your dataset. Letâ€™s break it down:  

### **1. What is a Correlation Matrix?**  
- A **correlation matrix** is a table that shows correlation coefficients between multiple variables.  
- The values range from **-1 to 1**:
  - **1.00** â†’ Perfect positive correlation (as one increases, the other also increases).  
  - **0.00** â†’ No correlation (variables are independent).  
  - **-1.00** â†’ Perfect negative correlation (as one increases, the other decreases).  

### **2. What Does the Heatmap Show?**  
- **Diagonal values** are always `1.00` (because a variable is always 100% correlated with itself).  
- **Red shades** indicate **strong positive correlations**, meaning variables move together.  
- **Blue shades** indicate **weak or negative correlations**, meaning variables are independent or move oppositely.  
- **Neutral colors (white/gray)** mean weak or no correlation.  

### **3. Observations from Your Heatmap:**  
- `credit_score` and `score_adjustment` (0.90) â†’ Strongly correlated, meaning **higher credit scores** lead to similar adjustments.  
- `years_with_bank` and `bank_adjustment` (0.85) â†’ **More years with the bank** might result in **higher bank adjustments**.  
- `trend_adjustment` and `adjustment_bps` (0.94) â†’ Very strong correlation, meaning these adjustments likely **influence each other**.  
- `deposit_amount` and other variables show weaker correlations, meaning **deposit amounts donâ€™t strongly affect other features**.  

### **4. Why is This Useful?**  
- **Feature Selection**: Identify which variables contribute most to a prediction model.  
- **Multicollinearity Check**: If two features are highly correlated, one may be redundant.  
- **Business Insights**: For example, a bank can **adjust loan interest rates** based on trends in customer credit scores.
